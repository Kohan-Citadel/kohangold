;; Directories:

;; - Maps are located in "Maps\campaign name\"
;;
;; Suggested Nomenclature:
;; - campaign INIs, mission section names and story INIs can be named anything, 
;;   but it may help a great deal to stick to a standard, such as CxMy where
;;   x is a number associated with the campaign, and y with the mission.  
;; - Referring to Missions By Name: always refer to missions by their section 
;;   name (which you may or may not want to be based on some code).  The "Name"
;;   field for a mission is the descriptive name presented to the user.
;;
;; Expansion = 
;; - 0			means "works with any expansion"
;; - 1 			default. means "original version only", or "designed to not be played with
;;				any expansion". This will give the user a warning if expansions are present. 
;; - 2,3,4,...	means "requires expansions".  Will give the user an error if the required
;;			    expansions are not present.  These are bit values, and expansions each
;;				have unique values of 2,4,8,16,32,64,etc.  If you want to require expansions
;;				2,4, and 8 you would simply use the total "Expansion = 14"

Name = They Are Called Rhaksha
Sound = Eben\C1M1_WB.wav
Text0 = Now that your new homeland is secure, the scholars have had time to study the remains of those creatures we
Text1 = encountered and discuss them with the locals. They are called Rhaksha by the village folk, and are dangerous
Text2 = creatures indeed. They began appearing years ago and spread like an infestation across the land. First, one
Text3 = mound-like nest will spring up overnight. Then they begin to spread, building more nests as their numbers
Text4 = increase. Soon enough, they are befouling the land for miles in every direction. We will need to keep watch
Text5 = for signs of these creatures and dispose of them whenever possible.
Text6 = &return. &return.
Text7 = Lord Darius, word of your arrival here is spreading. We have received a missive from north of the Marble Hills
Text8 = requesting your assistance. The sender of this message claims to be an immortal such as you. I assume you will

Text1 = Khaldun doesn't have much of a chance if the one destined to save it cannot manage such simple tasks.
Sprite = Portraits\Heroes\Big_Eben_Baruch_portrait.tgr

[C1M1 - PreBriefing]
Name = Where It All Begins
Sound = Eben\C1M1_PB.wav
Text0 = You have entered a new land Darius, one on the edge of all the turmoil about to befall this world. This is
Text1 = where it all begins. You must prepare this new land as I have taught you and rid it of any dangers that may
Text2 = threaten your quest. Go now and seek your destiny.
Sprite = Portraits\Heroes\Big_Eben_Baruch_portrait.tgr

[C1M2 - WinBriefing]
Name = Personal Victory
Sound = Eben\C1M2_WB.wav
Text0 = Your courage has served you well, my Lord. You bested the Drauga Chieftain in personal combat, securing the
Text1 = loyalty of a great number of powerful warriors. They are strong, but they are also in need of leadership.
Text2 = Their homelands are under assault by hordes of those Rhaksha creatures. The Drauga advisors suggest that we
Text3 = attend to this problem immediately. Otherwise, the Drauga may decide to abandon you over concern for their

[C1M2 - LoseBriefing]
Name = Drauga Too Strong

[C1M2 - PreBriefing]
Name = Immortal Brother
Sound = Eben\C1M2_PB.wav
Text0 = Another immortal has called out to you and requested your aid. Like you, he has taken stewardship over a small
Text1 = kingdom of the mortals we know as Mareten. His kingdom is besieged by another mortal race, the Drauga. They are
Text2 = a powerful and warlike people, but are not prone to reckless conquest such as this. You must protect this new

[C1M3 - WinBriefing]
Name = Cleansed Land
Sound = Kyran\C1M3_WB.wav
Text0 = You have done very well, Kohan Lord. The Rhaksha have been cleared from this land and the Drauga now defer to
Text1 = you with total loyalty. I believe I will stay here and administrate that support. I offer you good luck on your
Text2 = journey. May destiny guide you to victory. Perhaps we will have the chance to fight side by side again some day.

Name = Rampant Rhaksha

Text2 = support you any further.
Sprite = Portraits\Heroes\Big_Eben_Baruch_portrait.tgr

[C1M3 - PreBriefing]
Name = Blight Upon the Land
Sound = Eben\C1M3_PB.wav
Text0 = Your victory over the Drauga leader Garoj'mok has given you the reign of his tribe and the reasons behind the
Text1 = invasion into Mareten lands. These Rhaksha appear to be more than the simple nuisance we first surmised. They
Text2 = are spreading across the Drauga homeland like a virus. You must find the source of this blight and cure this
Text3 = land. The Drauga would be unshakable allies in the trying times to come.
Sprite = Portraits\Heroes\Big_Eben_Baruch_portrait.tgr

[C1M4 - WinBriefing]
Name = Haroun United
Sound = Eben\C1M4_WB.wav
Text0 = The Haroun are united once more, and support your banner as strongly as the Drauga. This bodes well for the
Text1 = future of your quest, Darius. The Haroun brought with them more than military support. They bring knowledge as
Text2 = well. The scholars suspected this for some time now, and the Haroun elders confirm it. The Drauga and Haroun
Text3 = are descended from Kohan blood as are the Mareten. Kohan of old had bore children and these children were mortal,
Text4 = unlike their parents. The constant loss of their loved ones eventually caused the Kohan to disassociate themselves
Text5 = from their mortal progeny, who left to form their own cultures. The Mareten, Drauga, and Haroun are the
Text6 = descendants of these cultures. Their pronounced differences mirror the normal, Al'daragu, and Al'harun forms

Name = War With the Haroun

Sprite = Portraits\Heroes\Big_Eben_Baruch_portrait.tgr

[C1M4 - PreBriefing]
Name = Mortal Politics
Sound = Eben\C1M4_PB.wav
Text0 = The Haroun are an esoteric people and must be handled delicately. If what we know is true, than the Haroun
Text1 = kingdom has splintered over how to deal with you and your growing armies. You must make them see that you
Text2 = are here to help and protect them. You must gain the control of all the Haroun Sanctuaries that broke off from
Text3 = the greater kingdom at any cost. A full alliance must be gained with the Haroun kingdom as well. Only when both
Text4 = of these things have been accomplished will you be able to reunite the Haroun into a single ally that will
Text5 = support your quest. 
Sprite = Portraits\Heroes\Big_Eben_Baruch_portrait.tgr

[C1M5 - WinBriefing]
Name = Ceyah Still Exist
Sound = Eben\C1M5_WB.wav
Text0 = It is disturbing to learn that the Ceyah Kohan still exist to this day. The Ceyah were Kohan that turned to the
Text1 = Shadow during the first Cataclysm. They were exiled for their crimes and hadn't been seen since. Until today, that
Text2 = is. We have taken Shohn Maht's amulet and will carry it with us. Perhaps someday, when all this is over, he can be
Text3 = reawakened and put on trial for his crimes. Until then, the amulet will stay carefully guarded.
Text4 = &return. &return.
Text5 = It is time to move east through the Deepwood and make our way to the Sinking Sands. The desert comprises the only
Text6 = land bridge between the western and eastern continents. We must control that region to keep the lands we have
Text7 = liberated safe. As we travel through the Deepwood, we should keep an eye out for any ruins on the southern edge
Text8 = of the woods. The scholars believe that we might find one of the Kohan Cities of Power. I know little of them,
Text9 = but the scholars agree that they were the centers of your civilization when the Kohan held dominion over these
Text10 = lands. If the ruins are to be found in the Deepwood, you cannot pass up the opportunity of excavating it.

Name = Shohn Maht Victorious

Name = Grip Of Fear

Text0 = The rumors we have been hearing appear to be true, Kohan Lord. By all accounts gained from the refugees huddled
Text1 = within this seaside village, there is an immortal monster that holds this land in a grip of fear. It can only
Text2 = be a Ceyah Kohan, one of the Dark Ones. You must rise up and meet this challenge head on Darius. It is the

Name = Sincere Thanks

Text2 = while, they are safe once more. If I may be so bold to ask, I wish to travel with you and assist in your quest.

Text0 = I thank you greatly for coming to my aid so quickly, m'Lord. You are as bold and determined as the rumors say.
Text1 = My name is Roxanna Javidan. Yes, I am from the same House as you, but I too remember little of what our glory
Text2 = once was. Now is not the time to reminisce, for this land is under near constant attack by the Dark Master. I 
Text3 = cannot determine how the forces of Shadow continue to enter this land, but most attacks come from the west.

[C1M7 - WinBriefing]
Name = Worshipping the Ceyah
Sound = Eben\C1M7_WB.wav
Text0 = It is disturbing to learn that the Rhaksha are not exactly the mindless beasts we have always thought them to be.
Text1 = If they are worshipping one of the Ceyah Kohan as their god, then they may also be receiving his aid. The only way
Text2 = to put an end to their building menace may be to find Amon Koth and destroy him as well. Until we confront him, we
Text3 = cannot be sure of his involvement in this matter. In any case the danger here is over and the people can return
Text4 = to their everyday lives once more.

Sprite = Portraits\Heroes\Big_Eben_Baruch_portrait.tgr

[C1M7 - PreBriefing]
Name = War Of Monsters
Sound = Eben\C1M7_PB.wav
Text0 = You are coming closer to freeing this land from the grip of the Dark Master. Now you must travel toward the Sinking
Text1 = Sands, a desert that connects the western half of Khaldun with the east. There are disconcerting reports coming
Text2 = from that direction. Reports of those Rhaksha creatures running amok across vast stretches of land. What is truly
Text3 = bizarre though are the reports claiming that the Rhaksha are killing each other as if they have all gone mad. You
Text4 = must be careful. We know little of what is occurring in those lands, making this leg of our journey all the more
Text5 = dangerous.
Sprite = Portraits\Heroes\Big_Eben_Baruch_portrait.tgr

[C1M8 - WinBriefing]
Name = Grim Reports
Sound = Roxanna\C1M8_WB.wav
Text0 = Today was a great victory Darius! Your army swept across the desert and sent the armies of the Dark Master
Text1 = fleeing into the sands. We have secured the land bridge and by doing so can quickly proceed east. That is a
Text2 = good thing, for your scouts have returned from the nearby lands and the reports are grim. A great number of
Text3 = Haroun people are besieged by Rhaksha and are in dire need of help. Some of us must stay behind and
Text4 = shore up the defenses of this area, to prevent the Ceyah from returning here. I will continue to travel with you
Text5 = though.
Sprite = Portraits\Heroes\Big_Roxanna_Javidan_portrait.tgr

[C1M8 - LoseBriefing]
Name = East is Lost

Sprite = Portraits\Heroes\Big_Eben_Baruch_portrait.tgr

[C1M8 - PreBriefing]
Name = Take The Offensive
Sound = Eben\C1M8_PB.wav
Text0 = Darius, there is word of a large army under the Ceyah banner forming at the eastern end of the Sinking Sands. They
Text1 = are forming slowly, but surely. You must act now if you are to gain control of the land bridge between the two
Text2 = continents. The army lies far to the east, on the shores of an inland sea. You must travel there quickly, but gather
Text3 = as many additional men and resources on the way as possible. We must choose whether to move along the southern
Text4 = edge of the land bridge, along the northern edge, or straight up the middle. Each has its own potential benefits.
Text5 = Gauri are known to live among the mountains in the north. Drauga and Mareten live along the southern edge. Yet the

Text1 = a force as strong as Amon Koth and his Rhaksha. His reign of terror was cut short here and you have gained an
Text2 = advantage against the Dark Master by removing the well from which the Rhaksha came. You have proven to me you
Text3 = are Darius Javidan, leader of House Javidan.
Text4 = &return. &return.
Text5 = Now I have something I must tell you. I am not simply a member of House Javidan. I am your wife. We were married
Text6 = once, long, long ago. It was before even the first Cataclysm. That was when I lost you, the day you died. You died

Text0 = We have entered this land in hopes to rid Khaldun of the Rhaksha threat once and for all. What you face before you
Text1 = in this land is the Ceyah known as Amon Koth. Piecing together all we have learned about the Rhaksha point to him

Text0 = Now that the Rhaksha are scattered and their father defeated, you can turn your attentions north and secure

Text2 = The Ceyah have established control of at least one kingdom here and another is on the verge of falling as well.

Text1 = spies watching us even now, or magic capable of peering upon us when we make plans. I do not believe the
Text2 = Cataclysm has begun yet. The quakes could very well have been linked to an increase in the Dark Master's power,

Text0 = Now that we have taken control of the North it is time for you to make a bold move. Your army has grown and you
Text1 = have many Kohan supporting you. There is a port city just south along the western coast. This would provide the
