Text0 = Your invasion of this island can not be forgiven. All that we have will be sent against you until the Ceyah are

Sound = AGM13\agm13_5.wav
Text0 = North of the Citadel is a large ancient burial ground, covered in gravestones and cairns. The dead are very restless

Name = Vashti to Ravid
Sound = AGM13\agm13_6.wav
Text0 = Bold words for a condemned man. The Kohan have no place in the Dark Master's great vision for Khaldun. I am his
Text1 = herald, and once I have cleansed Khaldun of Kohan filth such as you, I will sit by his right hand, ruling all
Text2 = that I see. The only way you can escape death is to prostrate yourself before me and swear allegiance to the Nightbringer.

Text0 = It is you and your men who should be pondering flight, Mehrdad. I have the full might of the Dark Master behind me.
Text1 = What have you, but a dwindling army of fools and dreamers. Do you honestly think that such a pitiful force can
Text2 = pose a threat to me? I suppose I must count you as both fool and dreamer.

Name = Vashti Muses
Sound = AGM13\agm13_8.wav
Text0 = The Isle of the Ancients, a most fitting stage for the genesis of Ahriman's vision. It has been many Ages since I
Text1 = have set foot upon this island. How appropriate for the Dark Master to raise his Citadel on the very spot Lord
Text2 = Darius was slain by my own hand. The view from the hanging dungeons almost matches that of our bedchamber so long
Text3 = ago. Yet much else has changed and I cannot afford to let my guard down now. The price of failure is not something
Text4 = I wish to dwell upon.

Text0 = The monolith we found was once part of a larger ruin, Mistress. There are ancient writings left upon it, as well
Text1 = as, on the rubble scattered around it. From what our priests can translate, the writings include some broken details of a
Text2 = great prophecy. One dealing with the fate of Khaldun. The name of Javidan was found to be mentioned more than once.

Name = Above All Others
Sound = AGM14\agm14_1.wav
Text0 = All the plans I have so carefully tended are now beginning to bear fruit. Darius is trapped and his
Text1 = reinforcements cannot land so long as we hold the port. I shall have his amulet in my possession before the
Text2 = day is out. I will personally bring it before Ahriman and demand to be placed above all other Ceyah Lords. He cannot
Text3 = refuse me so long as I possess Darius' amulet. The other Lords must bow before me and Khaldun shall be mine alone.

Name = Lost Love
Sound = AGM14\agm14_3.wav
Text0 = It is still hard for me to accept. Roxanna murdered me, bringing about the first Cataclysm. How could she have
Text1 = been seduced by Ahriman's power? I only now remember all that I once was, and my fondest memory has
Text2 = become my greatest sorrow. She is lost to me now. May the Creator shelter her soul when all things end.

[C2M14 - Story4]
Name = The Taint
Sound = AGM14\agm14_4.wav
Text0 = All is not lost, Lord Darius. That which has been tainted can still be cleansed. The taint of Ahriman's
Text1 = influence grows only in those who are awake and taking advantage of its power. Your wife has been asleep for
Text2 = nearly as long as yourself. This has sheltered her soul from becoming so tainted that she cannot be saved.
Text3 = You must win this battle, Darius. Though it may pain you, Roxanna must be defeated and returned to her amulet.
Text4 = Together we can reawaken her and begin to cleanse her soul. The blessings of the Creator are with you. Now go.
