Description                 =   The Bone Reaver is the result of countless studies and experiments to perfect the creation of undead warriors. The components used to animate them, as well as the necessity of using quality corpses, has resulted in a far deadlier variant that is faster, sturdier and more expensive than their lesser counterparts.
