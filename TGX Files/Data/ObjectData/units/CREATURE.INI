Description 		= These twisted horrors are fear made manifest, drawn forth by dark rituals from the plane of shadow. Not creatures themselves, they are extensions of the Endless Hunger and feed upon the nightmares of mortal and immortal minds alike. Thier incorporeal form renders most weapons useless against them, but the magicks binding them to life are quickly undone by even simple arcane interference.
