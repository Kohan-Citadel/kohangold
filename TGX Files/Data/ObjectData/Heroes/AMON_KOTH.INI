Description = Amon Koth was not originally condemned as Ceyah Kohan during the initial purge. He willingly chose exile and followed after some of the other Ceyah Kohan that had been ostracized. He eventually found himself deep underground and separated from all of the other Ceyah Kohan. It was here that he somehow spawned his 'children', the Rhaksha. No one knows how he managed this, or why. He has established himself as their god and master, and continues to rule over them still.
