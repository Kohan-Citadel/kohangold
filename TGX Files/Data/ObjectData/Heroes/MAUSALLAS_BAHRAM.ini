Description                     =   Mausallas Bahram possesses an unusual beauty, her unkempt shock of reddish-blonde hair and prominent nose conflicting with her serene brown eyes and ruby-red lips. Her beauty belies her intense intelligence and commanding grasp of the realm of magic. She is an accomplished warrior-mage, often found leading the charge against the forces of the Shadow, as well as wreaking havoc with her command of lightning. In melee, Mausallas wields a blackened longblade called Sta'archan that slices through the armor of her enemies with frightening ease. ;'
