Description                     =   Amon Koth was not originally condemned as Ceyah Kohan during the initial purge. Instead he self exiled himself, following after some of the other Ceyah Kohan that had been ostracized. He eventually found himself deep underground, separated from all of the other Ceyah Kohan. It was here that he somehow spawned his 'children', the Rhaksha. No one knows how he managed this, or why. He has set himself up as their God and master, and rules over them still today.
