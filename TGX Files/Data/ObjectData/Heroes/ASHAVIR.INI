Description         =   Ashavir is a true mercenary. He changes sides the moment he sees greater opportunity in the other camp. Known for his handsome appearance and his seductive ways, Ashavir is perhaps the most selfish of all Ceyah, caring nothing for political or religious ideals. He has even been known to work for Nationalist concerns against the Ceyah Lords. Even so, Ahriman has blessed him with great power, though none of the other Ceyah can fathom the reason behind this.
