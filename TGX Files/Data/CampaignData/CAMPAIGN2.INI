[ATM1 - Story1]
Name = Control Zones
Sound = Eben\ATM1_1.wav
Text0 = Before you is a company of footmen with scouts to provide them a slightly larger visual range. The Control Zone
Text1 = of the company is not visible yet. To make it visible the Zone of Control button, flashing now, must be pressed.
Text2 = Press the Zone of Control button now.
Sprite = Portraits\Heroes\Eben_Baruch_portrait.tgr

[ATM1 - Story2]
Name = Control Zones Visible
Sound = Eben\ATM1_2.wav
Text0 = Good, now you shoud see a green shaded area around the company. This is their Zone of Control. This Zone
Text1 = represents how far out the company exerts its military control over the terrain. This Zone is used in numerous
Text2 = ways during play. Press OK to continue.
Sprite = Portraits\Heroes\Eben_Baruch_portrait.tgr

[ATM1 - Story3]
Name = Enemy Control Zone
Sound = Eben\ATM1_3.wav
Text0 = Just inside the company's visual range on the right there is a yellow shaded area. This is the Control Zone of
Text1 = an enemy company. Select your company.
Sprite = Portraits\Heroes\Eben_Baruch_portrait.tgr

[ATM1 - Story4]
Name = Zone Interaction
Sound = Eben\ATM1_4.wav
Text0 = Okay, now command the company to move toward the enemy Control Zone until their Zone overlaps the enemies.
Sprite = Portraits\Heroes\Eben_Baruch_portrait.tgr

[ATM1 - Story5]
Name = Combat Begins
Sound = Eben\ATM1_5.wav
Text0 = Good, as you can see the moment the Zones overlapped a combat was initiated between the two companies. Zones
Text1 = of Control are how companies know when an enemy has come within combat range. The interaction of enemy Zone of Control's
Text2 = will usually result in a fight. Press OK to continue.
Sprite = Portraits\Heroes\Eben_Baruch_portrait.tgr

[ATM1 - Story6]
Name = Supply
Sound = Eben\ATM1_6.wav
Text0 = Now you are looking at a company of scouts that are resupplying near a small village. Notice that they are not
Text1 = actually in the supply zone of the village. You can hit Ctrl-S to verify this. Though the units
Text2 = themselves are not in supply, their Zone of Control is. This is another value of the Zone of Control. Press OK to continue.
Sprite = Portraits\Heroes\Eben_Baruch_portrait.tgr

[ATM1 - Story7]
Name = Ignoring Combat
Sound = Eben\ATM1_7.wav
Text0 = Again you see that there is an enemy Zone of Control nearby. This time you are going to move your company through the enemy
Text1 = without engaging them. This is done by switching to Pressed Column formation before moving. Column and Pressed 
Text2 = Column are passive formations and prevent the company from engaging unless directly commanded to do so. Select
Text3 = the scout now.
Sprite = Portraits\Heroes\Eben_Baruch_portrait.tgr

[ATM1 - Story8]
Name = Bullrush
Sound = Eben\ATM1_8.wav
Text0 = Okay, now put the scouts into Pressed Column formation and move them toward the enemy. Be sure to click past the
Text1 = enemy company. The enemy will attack your company, but your company will try to get past the enemy, refusing to
Text2 = engage them. Some units may get caught and forced to fight. Your company will leave them behind. 
Sprite = Portraits\Heroes\Eben_Baruch_portrait.tgr

[ATM1 - Story9]
Name = The Spire
Sound = Eben\ATM1_9.wav
Text0 = Good, your company pushed past the enemy and made it to the spire. Realize that if both your company and an enemy
Text1 = company are in a Pressed formation, they will ignore each other entirely. Column formation is very similar, but
Text2 = if attacked the company will stop and fight. They will however ignore other companies in Column or Pressed
Text3 = formation. Press OK to continue.
Sprite = Portraits\Heroes\Eben_Baruch_portrait.tgr

[ATM1 - Story10]
Name = Guard Zones
Sound = Eben\ATM1_10.wav
Text0 = We have moved to yet another company, this time an infantry company. They were sent south of their citadel to protect the
Text1 = gold deposit found there. You can guard a location in two ways. You can leave the company near the object and hope
Text2 = that the Zone of Control of an enemy hits your company's Zone of Control when they come near. The more efficient way is to use the company's
Text3 = Guard Zone. Press OK to continue.
Sprite = Portraits\Heroes\Eben_Baruch_portrait.tgr

[ATM1 - Story11]
Name = City Guard Zone
Sound = Eben\ATM1_11.wav
Text0 = Your company is not the only thing in the game with a guard zone. Any building that contains militia has a Guard Zone. The city
Text1 = above the infantry has a Guard Zone. Hit Ctrl-X to see the Guard Zone, it will show up as an orange shaded area.
Text2 = Any enemy that enters that Zone will cause the militia to attack them. Now go ahead and select the infantry
Text3 = company.
Sprite = Portraits\Heroes\Eben_Baruch_portrait.tgr

[ATM1 - Story12]
Name = Guarding the Gold
Sound = Eben\ATM1_12.wav
Text0 = Guard Zones work a bit differently for companies. A company must be told to guard a location to make it use its
Text1 = Guard Zone. I want you to have the infantry guard the gold deposit. Click on the Guard button and then select a
Text2 = location close to the deposit.
Sprite = Portraits\Heroes\Eben_Baruch_portrait.tgr

[ATM1 - Story13]
Name = Settlers
Sound = Eben\ATM1_13.wav
Text0 = Good. The infantry are now guarding the gold deposit. A company's guard zone is as large as its visual range. If
Text1 = any enemy comes within sight they will be attacked. When combat is over, the company will return to its guard point.
Text2 = There is only one Zone left for me to teach you about now. Select the settlers that are near the city.
Sprite = Portraits\Heroes\Eben_Baruch_portrait.tgr

[ATM1 - Story14]
Name = Population Zone
Sound = Eben\ATM1_14.wav
Text0 = All right, now I want you to try and settle a new village near the gold mine. Click on settle and try to place the
Text1 = village near the gold. You should receive an error message. That is because you cannot settle new villages within
Text2 = a certain distance of other, pre-existing settlements. To settle your village, move the settlers straight north of
Text3 = the citadel until they are out of the citadel's Supply Zone.
Sprite = Portraits\Heroes\Eben_Baruch_portrait.tgr

[ATM1 - Story15]
Name = Move Out of the Zone
Sound = Eben\ATM1_15.wav
Text0 = Now that they are out of supply, they should be beyond the citadel's Population Zone. That is the blue Zone that
Text1 = appears whenever you wish to settle a new village. It can also be seen by pressing Ctrl-P. Turn off the Zone of
Text2 = Supply and see if there is a blue Zone where the settlers are. If so, move them beyond it and settle your village.
Sprite = Portraits\Heroes\Eben_Baruch_portrait.tgr

[ATM1 - Story16]
Name = Village Settled
Sound = Eben\ATM1_16.wav
Text0 = There you are. The new village is settled and is now creating its own Population Zone. This Zone is very important
Text1 = to remember as it will limit where you can expand your empire with new settlements. This concludes the first
Text2 = advanced tutorial scenario.
Sprite = Portraits\Heroes\Eben_Baruch_portrait.tgr

[ATM1 - Story17]
Name = Another Use
Sound = Eben\ATM1_17.wav
Text0 = I have moved you over to another company to demonstrate another use for the Control Zone. When you are out scouting
Text1 = for gold, technologies, and amulets you must explore lost temples and similar buildings to find them. Any ruin you
Text2 = see is not considered explored until one of your companys' Zone of Control touches it. Select the company and move them straight
Text3 = east to see what I mean. Make sure Zone of Control's are still visible before you do so.
Sprite = Portraits\Heroes\Eben_Baruch_portrait.tgr

[ATM1 - Story18]
Name = Ruin Explored
Sound = Eben\ATM1_18.wav
Text0 = There you have it. The moment the Zone of Control overlapped the ancient ruin, it was explored, and you gained a nice sum of
Text1 = gold. There are a couple more things left to show you. Press OK to continue.

Text0 = Let's get started. Before you there are two of your companies. You can select the companies individually or together.
Text1 = By selecting them together you form a temporary group. To select them as a group, click-drag your cursor to form
Text2 = a selection box encompassing both companies. Select them now.
Sprite = Portraits\Heroes\Eben_Baruch_portrait.tgr

[ATM2 - Story2]
Name = First Group
Sound = Eben\ATM2_2.wav
Text0 = There you go. You now have a two-company grouping. Take a look at how the company interface has changed to display
Text1 = both companies. This is the grouping, or regiment, interface. This interface displays the banners of each company
Text2 = along with health meters for each unit within. Press OK to continue.

[ATM2 - Story3]
Name = Adding a Company
Sound = Eben\ATM2_3.wav
Text0 = As you can see, another company has joined your side. I want you to add this new company to your current group, but
Text1 = I don't want you to drag-select over the whole group. There is another way to add the company. Hold the Shift key
Text2 = down and left click on the new company.
Sprite = Portraits\Heroes\Eben_Baruch_portrait.tgr

[ATM2 - Story4]
Name = New Group

Text1 = interface below. To remove a company without reselecting a new group hold the Ctrl key down and left click on the
Text2 = company you wish to remove. Press OK to continue.
Sprite = Portraits\Heroes\Eben_Baruch_portrait.tgr

[ATM2 - Story5]
Name = Regiments
Sound = Eben\ATM2_5.wav
Text0 = There will be times when you will want to make a group into something more permanent. To support this need, you can
Text1 = turn a temporary group into a regiment. This is done by selecting a group of companies, holding down the Ctrl key,
Text2 = and pressing one of the number keys 0 through 9. Make sure you have all three companies selected and press Ctrl-1.
Sprite = Portraits\Heroes\Eben_Baruch_portrait.tgr

[ATM2 - Story6]
Name = First Regiment
Sound = Eben\ATM2_6.wav
Text0 = If you did as directed, you should be looking at the newly formed Regiment 1. There should be a set of small number
Text1 = 1's displayed at the corners of their banners. You will now be able to select this
Text2 = regiment every time you press the 1 key. To demonstrate this, select your village. This will deselect the regiment.

Text0 = There you have it. The regiment is once again selected. You may have noticed that another company has appeared.
Text1 = I want you to Shift-click on the new company to add it to the group.
Sprite = Portraits\Heroes\Eben_Baruch_portrait.tgr

[ATM2 - Story9]
Name = Adding and Removing
Sound = Eben\ATM2_9.wav
Text0 = Good. Shift-clicking to add a company only adds the company to the group. To include it in the regiment, you must
Text1 = press Ctrl-1 again. Do that now. The same goes for using Ctrl to remove companies from the regiment. The company
Text2 = removed from the group will still be part of the regiment.
Sprite = Portraits\Heroes\Eben_Baruch_portrait.tgr

[ATM2 - Story10]
Name = Skirmish Formation
Sound = Eben\ATM2_10.wav
Text0 = Now make sure you have the entire regiment selected. Now right-click down in the fog to the south. You should notice
Text1 = that the destinations of the companies are arranged in a box or diamond-like formation. This is because you still
Text2 = have Skirmish formation chosen for all the companies of the group.

Sprite = Portraits\Heroes\Eben_Baruch_portrait.tgr

[ATM2 - Story12]
Name = All Formations
Sound = Eben\ATM2_12.wav
Text0 = See how all the companies in the group get into column formation. Now move them back up by the village. You will
Text1 = see that not only do the companies get in column formation individually, but they form into a column as a group as
Text2 = well. All the formations work this way.
Sprite = Portraits\Heroes\Eben_Baruch_portrait.tgr

[ATM2 - Story13]
Name = Back Near Village
Sound = Eben\ATM2_13.wav
Text0 = The company is now back up by the village. Just north of the village is a lair full of monsters. I want you to
Text1 = move your regiment there to deal with them. It would be dangerous to move in column formation, so switch to
Text2 = combat formation. To arrange the companies along a nice solid front, right click and hold at the destination.
Text3 = Move your mouse right and left to rotate the ghost images of the companies until they all face north.
Sprite = Portraits\Heroes\Eben_Baruch_portrait.tgr

Text0 = Good work. There is only one more thing left to learn. You should have noticed by now that when you have a numbered
Text1 = group, or regiment, selected a new formation button appears. I want you to take two of your companies and arrange
Text2 = them side by side facing south. Then take the other two and place them in a row behind the first two, also facing

Text0 = Now move the regiment back toward the village. You will see that they move using the new custom formation you just
Text1 = created. If you were to rearrange them and lock the formation again, the new formation would be used as their

[ATM3 - Story1]
Name = Terrain Modifier
Sound = Eben\ATM3_1.wav
Text0 = Welcome to the third scenario of the advanced tutorials. We'll start by taking a look at how terrain affects
Text1 = your cities and companies. Before you are two villages. One is in the open grass, the other is squeezed
Text2 = in between a patch of forest and desert. Press OK to continue.
Sprite = Portraits\Heroes\Eben_Baruch_portrait.tgr

[ATM3 - Story2]
Name = Affect on Visual Zones
Sound = Eben\ATM3_2.wav
Text0 = As you can see, the visual range of the village in the grass is a nice circular shape, stretching an equal number of
Text1 = tiles in all directions. The other village however has a squashed visual range. This is because both forest and
Text2 = desert are difficult terrains to move through, shrinking the distance at which the village can detect things around it.
Text3 = Press OK to continue.
Sprite = Portraits\Heroes\Eben_Baruch_portrait.tgr

[ATM3 - Story3]
Name = Affect on Guard Zones
Sound = Eben\ATM3_3.wav
Text0 = Remember that a city can only supply as far as it sees, so terrain also affects the village's supply zones.
Text1 = Now press Ctrl-X to turn on the guard zones of the villages. As you can see, the terrain also affects the guard 
Text2 = zone of the village. Realize that buildings in the middle of the desert will have very small visual and guard zones.
Text3 = Please select either village to continue. 
Sprite = Portraits\Heroes\Eben_Baruch_portrait.tgr

[ATM3 - Story4]
Name = Company Zones
Sound = Eben\ATM3_4.wav
Text0 = Okay, we have moved away from the villages and given you a company to command. Buildings are not the only things
Text1 = affected by terrain. You have to pay attention to the terrain your companies are moving through even more than
Text2 = the terrain your buildings sit upon. Select the company.
Sprite = Portraits\Heroes\Eben_Baruch_portrait.tgr

[ATM3 - Story5]
Name = Moving Through Desert
Sound = Eben\ATM3_5.wav
Text0 = To the east of your company is a small desert with a forest on the other side. I want you to move the company into
Text1 = the middle of the desert, by the big rock you see there.
Sprite = Portraits\Heroes\Eben_Baruch_portrait.tgr

[ATM3 - Story6]
Name = By the Rock
Sound = Eben\ATM3_6.wav
Text0 = Did you notice how your company was affected by the desert? Their movement speed was drastically reduced, as was
Text1 = their visual range. Some terrains, such as desert and forest, are more difficult to move through. This will reduce
Text2 = both a company's speed and their visual range. Press OK to continue.
Sprite = Portraits\Heroes\Eben_Baruch_portrait.tgr

[ATM3 - Story7]
Name = Into the Forest
Sound = Eben\ATM3_7.wav
Text0 = Now before you move the company again, I want you to make the control zone visible. Hit Ctrl-C or click on the Zone of Control
Text1 = button. Then move the company straight east into the forest until you find the spire. Pay attention as to how the
Text2 = control zone is very small in the desert, but increases in size when the company enters the forest.
Sprite = Portraits\Heroes\Eben_Baruch_portrait.tgr

[ATM3 - Story8]
Name = At the Spire
Sound = Eben\ATM3_8.wav
Text0 = Okay, they are near the spire now. Did you see how the zone increased? You should have also seen their visual range
Text1 = and movement rate increase. Forest is less constricting than desert, but more than grass. Now we are going to see 
Text2 = how terrain affects combat. Press OK to continue.
Sprite = Portraits\Heroes\Eben_Baruch_portrait.tgr

[ATM3 - Story9]
Name = Forest Defense
Sound = Eben\ATM3_9.wav
Text0 = Take a good look at your company's attributes. You should see that their defense value (DV) is higher than normal.
Text1 = This is because it has a positive bonus gained from the forest. Some terrains provide defensive
Text2 = bonuses to companies standing on them. The terrain used is determined by the tile the company banner occupies. Move
Text3 = the company back to the rock in the desert.
Sprite = Portraits\Heroes\Eben_Baruch_portrait.tgr

[ATM3 - Story10]
Name = Defense Gone
Sound = Eben\ATM3_10.wav
Text0 = As you can see, the defense of the company has returned to normal. Desert, like most terrain does not affect the
Text1 = defense of a company. I am now going to show you why this is important to realize. You are about to witness a fight
Text2 = between two sets of combatants. Both fights are identical with the exception of the weaker companies' terrain.
Text3 = Press OK to continue.
Sprite = Portraits\Heroes\Eben_Baruch_portrait.tgr

[ATM3 - Story11]
Name = The Fight
Sound = Eben\ATM3_11.wav
Text0 = Watch and see how differently the fights turn out. On open ground the first footmen had no chance against the 
Text1 = infantry company, but by fighting from the forest, the second footmen actually managed to hold out longer.
Text2 = Keep this in mind when picking your fights. When the combat is over press OK to continue.
Sprite = Portraits\Heroes\Eben_Baruch_portrait.tgr

[ATM3 - Story12]
Name = Formations
Sound = Eben\ATM3_12.wav
Text0 = Now we once again have a lone company sitting in the grass. There is one more thing that affects companies and that
Text1 = is the formations the company can move in. Currently they are resting in Skirmish formation. Skirmish formation
Text2 = provides the largest visual range and zone of control. Toggle the zone of control back on if you turned it off. Then select
Text3 = the company.
Sprite = Portraits\Heroes\Eben_Baruch_portrait.tgr

[ATM3 - Story13]
Name = Move in Column
Sound = Eben\ATM3_13.wav
Text0 = Now change them to column formation and move them to the West a couple tiles, not too far. You will see that while
Text1 = in column formation their zone of control and visual range are much smaller. Column is more defensive, they are not looking
Text2 = for a fight. Switch them to combat formation and head them straight east. You will find an enemy company waiting
Text3 = for you that direction. Note the zone of control and visual range changes combat formation causes.
Sprite = Portraits\Heroes\Eben_Baruch_portrait.tgr

[ATM3 - Story14]
Name = Entrenchment
Sound = Eben\ATM3_14.wav
Text0 = Your men have engaged the enemy company. They are identical to your company, but you will lose. They were waiting
Text1 = for you in Fortified formation. When a company sits in one place long enough they entrench and eventually fortify.
Text2 = This gives them a large defensive bonus, making them harder to defeat. Some companies entrench quicker, others not
Text3 = at all.
