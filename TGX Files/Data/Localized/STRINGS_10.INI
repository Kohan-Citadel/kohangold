6033	UnitData Description	530	A crack shot with the bow and equally deadly with his sword, Aethan Farhyd is one of the Nationalists' fiercest warriors. Always dressed in black from head to toe, Aethan prefers to keep to himself, usually skulking in the shadows. If he is found with others, it is usually with his close companions and only friends, Sebastian Atafeh and Ahikar Iraj. If those two are found together, he is often not far behind. It has long been rumored that Aethan had feelings for Ahikar, but if that is true, he has kept those feelings hidden.

6034	UnitData Description	539	Beloved wife of Sebastian Atafeh, the comely Ahikar Iraj is a fierce warrior in her own right. Ahikar wields a bow named Del'Kostan that gets more accurate the more she uses it in battle. Ahikar is the last living member of the House Iraj, once one of the most powerful Houses in the Council. Ahikar turned from the Council and joined the Nationalist movement when her House was slain and their amulets captured by the treacherous Ceyah Kohan, Ma'ar Nasai. She has sworn vengeance against the Ceyah at any cost by whatever means necessary.	Beloved wife of Sebastian Atafeh, the comely Ahikar Iraj is a fierce warrior in her own right.

6035	UnitData Description	395	A tall, athletic woman, Dali Azade is legendary for her speed and strength. She can outrun a horse over any distance and she never tires. She is disdainful of those who charge into battle on horseback, believing that a true warrior would face death on foot. Dali practices a form of meditation and control over her mind and body that renders her immune to enchantment and the effects of fatigue.

6036	UnitData Description	561	Darya Azar is dedicated to two things in life, the eradication of the Ceyah and the Royalist cause. Because the two are often inextricably intertwined, she is single-minded in her focus, choosing to ignore everything else in her life. While attractive, her hair is often unkempt and her eyes often have the glint of a zealot on a mission. All her actions are filled with an unshakable fervor and belief in her goal. She will do anything to accomplish her task, and only her devotion to the Royalist cause has kept her from being lumped in with the Nationalists.

6037	UnitData Description	513	Never far from Amon Koth, Jhaengus serves as lieutenant and advisor to the progenitor of the Rhaksha. As a warrior, Jhaengus is ferocious and almost unstoppable, but as an advisor, his feral nature renders most of his advice unpalatable even to Amon Koth. No one outside of Amon Koth knows the true nature of Jhaengus, or who he was before his transformation into this hideous beast of carnage and death. One thing is known for sure, his loyalty to Amon Koth is unquestionable and his lust for blood unquenchable.

6038	UnitData Description	511	As beautiful as she is deadly, Jilla Jannat thrives on conflict and debate and always seems to emerge victorious. Her raven black hair and sea-green eyes are at odds with the grim set of her lips and her aquiline nose. She eschewed the Nationalist leanings of her House and followed the path of the Council. Outwardly her actions have all supported the Council, though she has been accused of being sympathetic to the Ceyah. Outside of Council meetings Jilla keeps to herself, preferring to work in the shadows.

6039	UnitData Description	638	His confidants know that when Lucius commits himself to something, he considers it an irrevocable pledge to give everything he can to make it happen. It is this trait that makes him a staunch ally and an implacable foe.  A angry scar cutting across his face, haunted sky-blue eyes, and grim nature conceal a man who was once handsome, jovial, and a leading member of the Council. Lucius broke from the rest of House Ajam and joined the Royalist cause in the Sixth Age when his wife Lydian was killed and her amulet captured by the Ceyah. He became a tireless and bitter foe of the Ceyah, and to this day he searches for his wife's amulet.

6040	UnitData Description	544	Mausallas Bahram possesses an unusual beauty, her unkempt shock of reddish-blonde hair and prominent nose conflicting with her serene brown eyes and ruby-red lips. Her beauty belies her intense intelligence and commanding grasp of the realm of magic. She is an accomplished warrior-mage, often found leading the charge against the forces of the Shadow, as well as wreaking havoc with her command of lightning.

6041	UnitData Description	808	A giant of a man, Sebastian Atafeh is a formidable opponent on the battlefield. Caring little for caution and planning, Sebastian runs headlong into life assuming that he'll be able to fight his way out of whatever problems he encounters. While not a traditional leader, Sebastian often inspires others to great feats of courage and physical strength. His flowing hair, bushy beard, and refusal to wear any sort of helmet, mark him on the battlefield for all to see. Sebastian's devotion to the Nationalist cause is outmatched only by his devotion to his wife Ahikar. It is said that when she tasted her first death, he fought through hundreds of vile beasts of the Shadow to reach her amulet before it could be spirited away. Now, he is rarely far from her side, having never forgiven himself for her death.	A giant of a man, Sebastian Atafeh is a formidable opponent on the battlefield.

6042	UnitData Description	828	One of the greatest generals in the history of the Council, Solomon Ghaffar once served as Darius Javidan's right-hand man and his military prowess is legendary. When Darius's death precipitated the Great Cataclysm, Solomon was the first to mobilize the military for the fight against the Ceyah. His youthful appearance belies his almost encyclopedic knowledge of military tactics and strategy. It was Solomon who led the search for the treacherous Vashti, and it was Solomon who led the armies of the Council against the Ceyah throughout the Second Age. He was slain by the bow of Melchior late in the Second Age, but his amulet was spirited away and he was reawakened almost immediately. He has been a tireless warrior since, tasting defeat only rarely, and influencing generations of Mareten with his leadership and chivalry.

6043	UnitData Description	817	Zerin is an enigmatic figure, solitary and aloof even by the standards of the Kohan. Those that know him understand his grim nature for what it is - an obsession with uncovering the secrets of the cataclysms that have ravaged Khaldun. Once an avid scholar and prominent member of House Mordecai during the First Age, Zerin has since isolated himself from even his own House and focused solely on his research. Many speculate his research was responsible for the introduction of the Nightbringer to Nationalist society, though his fierce loyalty to the Nationalist cause is the only thing that is known for certain. In battle, Zerin is known for his ceremonial, heavily ornamented garbs and fearsome command of shadow magic. His ability to weaponise his dark knowledge has unnerved even the most powerful of the Ceyah.	Zerin is an enigmatic figure, solitary and aloof even by the standards of the Kohan.
