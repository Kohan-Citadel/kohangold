# Kohan Gold
Continuation of Brokensword's Patch 1.3.10 and ZebetiteGlitch's AlphaKohanDuels 3.3

# Instructions For Compiling
In order to compile the files into a .tgx, you'll need to get timoT's tgxpack here:
https://github.com/tim-de/tgxpack/releases

Clone or download a zip of this repo to a folder, then open up a command prompt (cmd) window in that location. Tgxpack.exe should be placed next to TGX Files, in the same folder.
Run tgxpack by simply typing tgxpack.exe (Or whatever version you're using) then follow the help commands.

Your next command should be:
tgxpack pack "TGX Files"

And you should have a working file that can be used with Kohan's mod launcher.![helpmecompile](https://github.com/Kohan-Citadel/kohangold-KG-/assets/55857098/21925e0b-7b34-40fe-813b-afaf711bc5a9)
